# Sorting-Visualizer
- Jeremy Dilman

This project is an interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built with Java Swing.  
It allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work step by step or automatically with animations.
Users can also customize the array size and initial ordering (random, partially sorted, reverse order).  

The program supports:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
